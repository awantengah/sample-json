Est autem etiam actio quaedam corporis, quae motus et status naturae congruentis tenet; Age nunc isti doceant, vel tu potius quis enim ista melius? Prioris generis est docilitas, memoria; Potius ergo illa dicantur: turpe esse, viri non esse debilitari dolore, frangi, succumbere. Duo Reges: constructio interrete. Eadem nunc mea adversum te oratio est. Hi curatione adhibita levantur in dies, valet alter plus cotidie, alter videt. </p><p>Ipse Epicurus fortasse redderet, ut Sextus Peducaeus, Sex. Nam illud vehementer repugnat, eundem beatum esse et multis malis oppressum. Sed quanta sit alias, nunc tantum possitne esse tanta. Ita ne hoc quidem modo paria peccata sunt. Certe nihil nisi quod possit ipsum propter se iure laudari. Scientiam pollicentur, quam non erat mirum sapientiae cupido patria esse cariorem. Quid igitur dubitamus in tota eius natura quaerere quid sit effectum? Expressa vero in iis aetatibus, quae iam confirmatae sunt. Quaeque de virtutibus dicta sunt, quem ad modum eae semper voluptatibus inhaererent, eadem de amicitia dicenda sunt. Quantum Aristoxeni ingenium consumptum videmus in musicis? </p><p>Sed nimis multa. Huius, Lyco, oratione locuples, rebus ipsis ielunior. Ab his oratores, ab his imperatores ac rerum publicarum principes extiterunt. Hoc tu nunc in illo probas. Nam cui proposito sit conservatio sui, necesse est huic partes quoque sui caras suo genere laudabiles. Non igitur potestis voluptate omnia dirigentes aut tueri aut retinere virtutem. </p>",
